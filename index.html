  <section class="scroll-body">
    <p>I was never too much — I just told the truth. I didn’t want to be hurt. I didn’t want to be unseen. Do you know what that ache really feels like? To be lying next to someone every day… and still feel invisible?</p>
    <p>To give your heart, your body, your prayers — and still not be chosen? To shrink your light for someone who never even knew how to hold it. I stayed too long in places I should’ve left the first time I felt my soul cry inside my body.</p>
    <p>I didn’t even really like half the men I gave myself to — I was just trying to be loved. To be accepted. To say I had someone. I thought being loved meant giving my body… my loyalty… my mind. Whole time, it was costing me my soul.</p>
    <p>This scroll is for the women who stayed too long, hoping love would remember them. It’s for the girls who never learned how to leave — because nobody taught them that saving yourself was holy.</p>
    <p>I’m still healing. Still learning. Still reclaiming my voice. But now… I remember who I am. I am that queen. That root. That birthright. That fire. That vault. And baby, this time? I ain’t breaking for no one.</p>
